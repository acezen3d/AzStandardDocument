| Name           | Type         | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TessMultiplier | Float(1,100) | 10            | The multiplier of the ratio of edge length to camera distance squared. Used to control how much the tessellation factor varies with edge length and camera distance.                                                                                       |
| TessMin        | Float(1,20)  | 2             | Minimum tessellation factor. The tessellation factor will eventually be clamped between `TessMin` and `TessMax`.                                                                                                                                           |
| TessMax        | Float(1,20)  | 10            | Maximum tessellation factor. The tessellation factor will eventually be clamped between `TessMin` and `TessMax`.                                                                                                                                           |
| TessSmooth     | Float(0,1)   | 1             | Interpolation of the vertex position between its original position and the tessellation smoothing position. Used to control the smoothness of the tessellation. Note that the higher the smoothness, the greater the deviation from the original position. |
| TessExtrusion  | Float(-1,1)  | 0             | Extrude the tessellated object along its normals.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| TessOffset     | Vector       | (0,0,0,0)     | Offset the tessellated object in its object space. ***red***: x-axis, ***green***: y-axis, ***blue***: z-axis, ***alpha***: not used.                                                                                                                      |
